### #2, June 16: Bitcoin Startups (panel)
While Hong Kong is esatblishing itself as a hotbed for startups in Asia, Bitcoin startups come here to find a mixed climate of welcoming regulation, apathetic government and a repellent financial system. In this panel we explore the challenges that particularly Bitcoin startups face, the problems they intend to solve and their view on Hong Kong as a developing Fintech center.
