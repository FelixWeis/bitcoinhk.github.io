<p>Congratulations! Youâ€™ve made the decision to accept Bitcoin payments. This is a great idea for your business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flexibility: You control the user experience of your consumers and have a large variety of processors to choose from. You can even run or build your own!</li>
  <li>Low fees: Fees can be as low as 0% if you host your own processor. Services that do this for you or convert your Bitcoin to HKD or USD typically charge between 0.5% and 2%.</li>
  <li>Irreversible: Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed by the customer, meaning there are zero fraud or chargeback risks. All refunds will have to be initiated by you.</li>
  <li>Community: Bitcoin users often seek out places and businesses that accept Bitcoin as payments. If you are a Hong Kong business accepting Bitcoin, write us, and we might promote you for free.</li>

<h3 id="option-c-btcpay">Option C: BTCPay</h3>

<p><a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay</a> is a software product rather than a service. As such, you will need to run the software yourself on your own server (for example for ~US$9 per month on <a href="https://medium.com/@BtcpayServer/launch-btcpay-server-via-web-interface-and-deploy-full-bitcoin-node-lnd-in-less-than-a-minute-dc8bc6f06a3">Lunanode</a>). Unlike with payment processers as-a-service, you will not need to sign up or provide identifying information. BTCPay charges no licensing fees, and all payments are handled by yourself without a fee. This is especially great if you have no intention of selling your Bitcoin, but you can also sell them through <a href="/buy-bitcoin-in-hong-kong/">an exchange or broker</a>.</p>

<p>You can use BTCPay as an online or offline tool, as well as use the API to integrate the system into your online shop.</p>
