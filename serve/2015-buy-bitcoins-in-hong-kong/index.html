  <h2 id="buying-bitcoins-in-hong-kong">Buying Bitcoins in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>The options on how to buy Bitcoin can be overwhelming at first. Unlike with centralized systems like Alipay or Paypal there is no ‘official’ way to fund your accounts, and fees vary across services and locations. As a rule of thumb, the more convenient and fast a HKD -&gt; Bitcoin exchange is, the higher the fees are.
Compared with selling Bitcoin, there is little risk associated with buying.
Unfortunately Bitcoin still does not have the legal status in Hong Kong that it deserves, and banks are reluctant to deal with companies and individuals associated with Bitcoin. In this environment it is easy for scammers to attempt to defraud you of your Dollars or Bitcoins in certain kinds of transactions.</p>

<h3 id="in-person">In Person</h3>

<p>Buying bitcoins in person has become less and less popular in Hong Kong in the past years, and few traders are still willing to meet you in a coffee shop or library to sell you Bitcoins. The website <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/hkd/ 18 listings">localbitcoins.com</a> as well as the Android app <a href="https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html">Mycelium</a> can be used to find people in Hong Kong to meet up with.
If you just need a few dollars worth to ‘try it out’ or ‘play with’ or need help setting up or operating your wallet, you will likely find somebody to trade at the regular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/">Bitcoin meetups</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: On Sunday, November 24, 2013 over 100 people met at the public area of Hysan Mall in Causeway Bay to trade and chat.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-atms">Bitcoin ATMs</h3>

<p>The most convenient way to buy Bitcoins is an ATM. Usually you only need to show the ATM the QR code of your Bitcoin address, insert bank notes and confirm the exchange rate. The process takes less than 30 seconds, is anonymous but can cost up to 5% in fees.</p>

<p>Bitcoin ATMs are located at:  <br />
<strong><a href="http://hkbitcoinatm.com/">President Commercial Centre</a></strong>, Shop 322, 3/F, 608 Nathan Road, <strong>Mong Kok</strong>  <br />
<strong><a href="https://www.bitfx.com/">Worldwide House</a></strong>, Shop 215, 2/F, 19 Des Voeux Road, <strong>Central</strong>  <br />
<strong><a href="http://www.hkbitcoinkiosk.com/">Worldwide House</a></strong>, Shop 357. 3/F, 19 Des Voeux Road, <strong>Central</strong>  <br />
<strong><a href="https://anxintl.com/contact-us/">CNT Tower</a></strong>, 18/F, 338 Hennessy Road, <strong>Wan Chai</strong>  <br />
<strong><a href="http://www.bitcoinatm.com.hk/">Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre</a></strong>, Room 1182, 1 Trademark Drive, <strong>Kowloon Bay</strong>    </p>

<p>You may also browse <a href="http://coinatmradar.com/">coinatmradar.com</a> for more or less up to date information on the location of Bitcoin ATMs.</p>

<h3 id="by-octopus-card">By Octopus Card</h3>

<p>With the help of Hong Kong ecommerce shop <a href="https://toofreetofail.com/">Too Free To Fail</a> you can exchange your old Octopus card to Bitcoin, though maximally 500 HKD per card.
Just visit <a href="https://toofreetofail.com/products/we-buy-your-old-octopus-card-for-bitcoin">this page on their store</a>, send in your old Octopus card by mail and receive shiny new Bitcoins in exchange.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-exchanges">Bitcoin Exchanges</h3>

<p>Buying Bitcoins on exchanges is usually the cheapest option in terms of fees and is relatively fast and convenient too. But it often requires a few days to set up an account and get verified, and you can expect exchanges based in Hong Kong to ask for your personal information like ID or address proof before you can start using their accounts.
Please note that Bitcoin exchanges are not to be treated as banks. We recommend you to withdraw your coins quickly after your purchase to a wallet you control, and never keep any funds on an exchange for a longer time.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://anxpro.com/">ANX</a></strong>
Once you are signed up and verified, depositing your Hong Kong dollars with ANX is easy. You can hand it over in cash at their retail store in Sai Ying Pun or main office in Wan Chai and it will be credited quickly to your account, where you can exchange them to Bitcoin and withdraw to your wallet.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://gatecoin.com/">Gatecoin</a></strong>
Gatecoin is a well established Bitcoin exchange operating in a global market from Hong Kong. You can send them local wire transfers from your Hong Kong Dollar bank account and have them credited to your account after verification.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.bitcashout.com/">Bitcashout</a></strong>
Bitcashout is a small and reliable Bitcoin exchange based in Hong Kong. You can deposit via wire transfer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://localbitcoins.com/country/HK">Localbitcoins</a></strong>
Localbitcoins is a decentralized exchange. That means that while Bitcoins are deposited into accounts held by the exchange, Hong Kong dollars are transacted via various means of payment directly between users. It is up to the user to follow the appropriate Anti-Money-Laundering and Know-Your-Customer rules.
This means you have to be extra careful who you interact with, and rates can be significantly higher than on other exchanges.</p>

<h3 id="earn-bitcoins">Earn Bitcoins</h3>

<p>The by far cheapest way to get Bitcoins is to accept them as payment. No matter if you run a business, are employed, do freelance work or your friends owe you money, it may be a good idea to ask for these payments to be made in Bitcoin. Especially online and in international transfers the instantaneous and near-free Bitcoin transactions are far superior to other means.
You can also consider listing your hostel or room on <a href="https://www.9flats.com/">9flats</a> instead of Airbnb and receive your payments in Bitcoin.
Many reward systems like <a href="https://www.pointshound.com/">pointshound</a> or <a href="https://www.hotelgo24.com/">HotelGo24</a> allow you to cash out your rewards directly in Bitcoin. So you pay as much for your travel bookings as you would elsewhere, but you get a tiny reward in Bitcoin as a kickback.</p>
