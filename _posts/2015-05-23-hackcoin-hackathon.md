### Hackcoin, Hong Kong's First Blockchain Hackathon

10 young coders arrived early in the morning of May 23 at Paperclip Startup Campus to come up with ideas, experiments and applications that only the Bitcoin blockchain could make happen. While Peter Thiel, co-founder of Paypal, collected entrance nearby from people who wanted to hear what made him rich, we took matters into our own hands to enhance the ecosystem around what we believe is our future financial system.

Adam Vaziri, founder of Diacle gave a quick introduction into the systems and APIs that were attractive for the participants to use. Two developers from NXT and Counterparty even agreed to be available for remote support calls from Israel and Taiwan.
Four teams were quickly formed, and everyone quickly stuck their heads together to get working, only interrupted for lunch from a local Cha Chaan Teng, which was sponsored by local Bitcoin exchange Gatecoin, who also heavily contributed to publicizing the event ([read a great post by Inggrid here](https://www.gatecoin.com/blog/2015/05/hk-first-blockchain-hackathod/).
