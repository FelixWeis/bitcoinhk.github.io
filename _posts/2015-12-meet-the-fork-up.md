## Let's Meet The Fork Up

We had our very first Bitcoin meetup here at Red Bar in summer of 2012, and we are more than happy the way our community has grown and matured since then. We invite you all to the roof top of IFC mall for drinks and snacks and of course great chats. It's public space, feel free to bring your own drinks or food, or buy directly from Red Bar.
