## Pay with Bitcoin

We love Bitcoin. We buy Bitcoin, we earn our wages in Bitcoin, and we like to accept Bitcoin. Some businesses in Hong Kong do, here's how you can spend your Bitcoin in Hong Kong.

### For consumers

Paying with Bitcoin helps you to understand how Bitcoin works and doesn't work. Using a cryptocurrency is an important part of 'do your own research' and helps reaffirm our beliefs and expectations. We especially recommend to try out Lightning transactions, as they are instantaneous and cheap.

### For merchants

[Follow this guide](/accept-bitcoin/) if you would like to get started with Bitcoin payments. Please contact us at [info@bitcoin.org.hk](mailto:info@bitcoin.org.hk) if you have questions or would like to have your business added to this list.
