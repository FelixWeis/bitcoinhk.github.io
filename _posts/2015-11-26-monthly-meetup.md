## Let's Talk About Bitcoin

The December meetup is a a bit early because of the [Scaling Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinhk.org/2015-12-scaling-bitcoin-announcement/) conference the week after. Meet up with the crowd, enjoy a drink or snacks and catch up on blockchain drama. Thank you [ANX](http://anxintl.com/) for hosting!
