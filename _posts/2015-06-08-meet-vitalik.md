## Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin

Ethereum Founder and Bitcoin Magazine writer Vitalik Buterin will be in town this Monday 5 June 2015 so hope you will all join for a casual drink at Grappa's! Nothing special planned, just another chance to gather. Please note for those interested in a talk by Vitalik, there will also be a more formal talk programmed on Tuesday evening organized through the Ethereum HK Meetup group.
