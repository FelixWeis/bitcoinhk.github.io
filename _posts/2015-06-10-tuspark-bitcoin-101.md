### #3, June 23: Bitcoin Regulation (panel)
While Bitcoin remains 'unregulated' in Hong Kong, few understand what this term actually means. In other places the situation is far more confusing, creating frustration among those who feel barred from creating and investing in Bitcoin ideas. How does Bitcoin fit into the existing financial regulatory framework of Hong Kong, and how might this change in the future?

### #4, June 30: Smart Contracts (panel)
Today's contracts are difficult enough to read for most humans, who barely skip through them even on the matter of life and death. How can contracts become smarter, machine readable and self-enforcable? Two talks explore what is possible today, and give an outlook more science than fiction.

### #2, July: Bitcoin Startups (panel)
While Hong Kong is establishing itself as a hotbed for startups in Asia, Bitcoin startups come here to find a mixed climate of welcoming regulation, apathetic government and a repellent financial system.
