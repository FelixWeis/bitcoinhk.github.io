## Buying Bitcoins in Hong Kong

The options on how to buy Bitcoin can be overwhelming at first. Unlike with centralized systems like Alipay or Paypal there is no 'official' way to fund your accounts, and fees vary across services and locations. As a rule of thumb, the more convenient and fast a HKD -> Bitcoin exchange is, the higher the fees are.

Compared with selling Bitcoin, there is little fraud risk associated with buying.
Unfortunately Bitcoin still does not have the legal status in Hong Kong that it deserves, and banks are reluctant to deal with companies and individuals associated with Bitcoin. In this environment it is easy for scammers to attempt to defraud you of your Dollars or Bitcoins in certain kinds of transactions.

### In Person

Buying bitcoins in person has become less and less popular in Hong Kong in the past years, and few traders are still willing to meet you in a coffee shop or library to sell you Bitcoins. The website [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/hkd/ 18 listings) as well as the Android app [Mycelium](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) can be used to find people in Hong Kong to meet up with.
If you just need a few dollars worth to 'try it out' or 'play with' or need help setting up or operating your wallet, you will likely find somebody to trade at the regular [Bitcoin meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/).

Historic fact: On Sunday, November 24, 2013 over 100 people met at the public area of Hysan Mall in Causeway Bay to trade and chat at an event "Satoshi Square". These events exist to highlight the peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin and are still occasionally held at the Bitcoin meetup.

### Bitcoin ATMs

The most convenient way to buy Bitcoins is an ATM. Usually you only need to show the ATM the QR code of your Bitcoin address, insert bank notes and confirm the exchange rate. The process takes less than 30 seconds, is anonymous but can cost up to 5% in fees. Prepare your wallet ahead of time, and bring exact change. ATMs generally accept only HKD bank notes.

Bitcoin ATMs are located at:    
**[President Commercial Centre](http://hkbitcoinatm.com/)**, Shop 322, 3/F, 608 Nathan Road, **Mong Kok**    
**[Shing Lee Shopping Arcade](http://hkbitcoinatm.com/)**, Shop 19, 1/F, 6 Wing Kut Street, **Central**    
**[T.Mark](http://hkbitcoinatm.com/)**, Shop 329, 3/F, 18 Tai Ho Road, **Tsuen Wan**    
**[CNT Tower](https://anxintl.com/contact-us/)**, 18/F, 338 Hennessy Road, **Wan Chai**    
**[CHIC by The Oyster House](http://www.bitcoinatm.com.hk/)**, 2/F, The Cameron, 33 Cameron Road, **Tsim Sha Tsui**    
**[NDNX CoWork Tech Hub](http://www.bitcoinatm.com.hk/)**, 27/F, 35 Hung To Road, **Kwun Tong**    

You may also browse [coinatmradar.com](http://coinatmradar.com/) for more or less up to date information on the location, uptime and rates of Bitcoin ATMs.

### By Wire Transfer

A convenient way to buy Bitcoins through Wire transfer is [Xapo](https://xapo.com/). You will be required to confirm your identity by uploading documents, such as ID scans and address proof. You will then be able to purchase Bitcoin through their portal and pay through a wire transfer to a Hong Kong bank account. This costs around 2% in fees. Xapo uses market rates at the level of major US exchanges.

### Bitcoin Exchanges

Buying Bitcoins on exchanges is usually the cheapest option in terms of fees and is relatively fast and convenient too. But it often requires a few days to set up an account and get verified, and you can expect exchanges based in Hong Kong to ask for your personal information like ID or address proof before you can start using their accounts.
Please note that Bitcoin exchanges are not to be treated as banks. We recommend you to withdraw your coins quickly after your purchase to a wallet you control, and never keep any funds on an exchange for a longer time.

#### Hong Kong Exchanges

There are currently four exchanges with local Hong Kong bank accounts. Some of these exchanges also accept cash deposits and cheques.

**[ANX](https://anxpro.com/)**
Once you are signed up and verified, depositing your Hong Kong dollars with ANX is easy. You can hand it over in cash at their main office in Wan Chai and it will be credited quickly to your account, where you can exchange them to Bitcoin and withdraw to your wallet.

**[Gatecoin](https://gatecoin.com/)**
Gatecoin is a well established Bitcoin exchange operating in a global market from Hong Kong. You can send them local wire transfers from your Hong Kong Dollar bank account and have them credited to your account after verification.

**[Bitcashout](https://www.bitcashout.com/)**
Bitcashout is a small and reliable Bitcoin exchange based in Hong Kong. You can deposit via wire transfer.

#### OTC Exchanges

For larger amounts, you can go to an OTC Exchange, or broker. A broker will give you a quick quote for a single trade, usually upwards of 50 BTC. You will be able to sell or buy Bitcoins against a wire transfer.

**[Gatecoin](https://gatecoin.com/)**
Same as the above mentioned exchange.

**[Octagon Financial](https://www.octfinancial.com/)**
Affiliated with ANX as mentioned above.

#### Overseas Exchanges

Some exchanges overseas serve the Hong Kong market. Wire transfers to these exchanges are more expensive, but often more reliable and there is significantly more market depth. Disputes however cannot easily be resolved through the Hong Kong legal system and can quickly become complicated and expensive to resolve.

**[Quoine](https://www.quoine.com/)**
Quoine is a Japanese exchange that offers HKD deposits into their Japanese bank accounts and HKD trading.

**[Gemini](https://gemini.com/)**
Gemini is a New York exchange that specializes on large volumes. It only accepts USD deposits and trading.

#### Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized Exchanges don't have their own bank accounts. Instead, buyers and sellers interact directly with each other when transfering money. It is up to the user to follow the appropriate Anti-Money-Laundering and Know-Your-Customer rules. The Bitcoins are held in escrow by the exchange. It's very important to make use of these escrow options and be careful who you interact with.

**[Localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/country/HK)**
Localbitcoins is a decentralized exchange managed from Finland.

**[Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/)**
Bitsquare is not a company, and is not run by anybody. Instead it acts as a network of users, which you can join by downloading the Bitsquare software. This software might be experimental at times, but shows promise in leading the way to a truly decentralized future.

### Earn Bitcoins

The by far cheapest way to get Bitcoins is to accept them as payment. No matter if you run a business, are employed, do freelance work or your friends owe you money, it may be a good idea to ask for these payments to be made in Bitcoin. Especially online and in international transfers the instantaneous and near-free Bitcoin transactions are far superior to other means.
You can also consider listing your hostel or room on [9flats](https://www.9flats.com/) instead of Airbnb and receive your payments in Bitcoin.
Many reward systems like [pointshound](https://www.pointshound.com/) or [HotelGo24](https://www.hotelgo24.com/) allow you to cash out your rewards directly in Bitcoin. So you pay as much for your travel bookings as you would elsewhere, but you get a tiny reward in Bitcoin as a kickback.
