## Chat with Morgan McKenney - Citi Head of Global Crossborder Payments Treasury Trade

Please join us as we have an informal conversation with Morgan McKenney, Citi Head of Global Cross-border Payments, Treasury and Trade Solutions as she and Jehan Chu discuss the view on Bitcoin, blockchain, and progress in general, from inside the fortress. Morgan also runs Citi's Singapore innovation lab, and will give insight on the ups and downs of trying to steer a glacier.
