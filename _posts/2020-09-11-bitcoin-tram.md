This September, you will notice three doubledecker trams in full Bitcoin livery cruising east and west the tracks on Hong Kong Island. Each tram carries the Bitcoin logo and lettering on its front and back. The trams are accompanied by 20 billboards in matching design.

The educational campaign is an initiative from the Hong Kong Bitcoin community coordinated by the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong. The campaign is financed with donations from the community.

### Messaging

The Bitcoin Tram campaign has the goal of matter-of-factly discuss the risks and merits of Bitcoin, especially in the context of ongoing financial and economic changes. It carries quotes by writer Stewart Brand and T.A.M. Craven, as well as facts about money printing and Bitcoin usage.

We hope the campaign will give us the opportunity to discuss how Bitcoin fits into a quickly digitizing global economy, the opportunities and dangers of drastic technological advancements and the implications of digital, verifiable scarcity.
